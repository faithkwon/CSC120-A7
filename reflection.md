- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
    I enjoyed programming with inheritance because it got rid of a lot of unnecessary repeat code. I especially liked how each subclass inherited its parent class' methods, so that I didn't have to write an accessor/mutator method for every single attribute. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    What worked was discussing the project and the logic of inheritance with classmates -- everything makes more sense when you talk to somebody else about it!
